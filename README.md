# RF-signal-based-UAV-Identification-and-Classification
RF Based UAV Detection and Defense Systems have become increasingly important as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) continues to grow in popularity. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has shown great potential for improving the accuracy and reliability of these systems. In this study a machine learning based approach for detection and classification of radio frequency signals from drones is proposed. As data source the DroneDetectV2 data set is used. Specifically, we focus on the application of deep learning techniques for UAV detection and classification using RF signals. We also discuss the challenges involved in training deep learning models for UAV detection and propose possible solutions to overcome these challenges. In this study, we have compared the classification results for two cases, while taking/ not taking flight modes of the drones into consideration. The results of this study demonstrate that deep learning can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of RF-based UAV detection and defense systems, making them an effective tool for protecting critical infrastructure and public safety.
